# My Claude Code Setup

> **Work in progress.** This is not meant to be a polished guide for everyone. It's mostly a summary of how I've been using Claude Code for academic work — creating lecture slides, writing R scripts, managing Beamer-to-Quarto workflows, and so on. I keep learning new things, and as I do, I keep updating these files. This is just a way for me to share what I've figured out with friends and colleagues.

**Live site:** [psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/)

A ready-to-fork starter kit for academics using [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with **LaTeX/Beamer + R + Quarto**. You describe what you want; Claude plans the approach, runs specialized agents, fixes issues, verifies quality, and presents results — like a contractor who handles the entire job. Extracted from a production PhD course.

---

## What This Is

This repository provides the **transportable infrastructure** behind a Claude Code workflow used to develop 6 complete PhD lecture decks (800+ slides) with:

- **Contractor-mode orchestrator** — you describe the task; Claude plans, implements, reviews with agents, fixes issues, and re-verifies until quality gates pass
- **Adversarial critic-fixer loops** — two agents check each other's work across up to 5 rounds, catching errors humans miss
- **Quality scoring** with commit/PR/excellence thresholds (80/90/95) — nothing ships below 80
- **Automated Beamer-to-Quarto translation** with TikZ-to-SVG and ggplot-to-plotly conversion
- 10 specialized agents, 13 slash commands, 12 auto-loaded rules

All domain-specific content has been replaced with `[PLACEHOLDER]` markers and `<!-- Customize -->` comments so you can adapt it to your field.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork this repo on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-code-my-workflow.git
cd claude-code-my-workflow
```

### 2. Customize CLAUDE.md

Open `CLAUDE.md` and fill in:
- Your course name, institution, and instructor name
- Your folder structure (or keep the default)
- Your design principles and preferences

**Tip:** Keep CLAUDE.md under ~150 lines for best results. Move detailed instructions into `.claude/rules/` files instead.

### 3. Create Your Knowledge Base

Open `.claude/rules/knowledge-base-template.md` and start filling in:
- Your notation conventions
- Your lecture progression
- Your running examples/applications

### 4. Test It

```bash
# Create a simple test .tex file in Slides/, then:
claude  # Start Claude Code
# Type: /compile-latex Slides/test.tex
```

If it compiles, your setup is working.

## The Guide

For a comprehensive walkthrough of the entire workflow, read the **[full guide](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html)** (or see the [source](guide/workflow-guide.qmd)).

It covers:
1. **Why This Workflow Exists** — the problem and the vision
2. **The Building Blocks** — CLAUDE.md, rules, skills, agents, settings, memory
3. **Setting Up Your Project** — step-by-step from fork to first compile
4. **The Agent Ecosystem** — why specialized agents beat one-size-fits-all prompts
5. **Quality Gates & Verification** — the 80/90/95 scoring system
6. **Workflow Patterns** — lecture creation, translation, replication, multi-agent review
7. **Customizing for Your Domain** — creating your own reviewers and knowledge bases

## Key Patterns

### Plan-First Workflow

Non-trivial tasks start in **plan mode** before any files are touched:
1. **Plan** — draft approach, list files to modify, identify risks
2. **Save** — persist the plan to `quality_reports/plans/` (survives context compression)
3. **Review** — present to user for approval
4. **Implement** — orchestrator takes over (see below)

Companion rule: **never use `/clear`**. Rely on auto-compression for context management — it preserves important context gracefully, while `/clear` destroys everything.

### Contractor Mode (Orchestrator)

After plan approval, the orchestrator takes over autonomously:
1. **Implement** the plan steps
2. **Verify** — compile, render, check outputs
3. **Review** — select agents by file type (.tex gets proofreader + slide-auditor + pedagogy-reviewer; .qmd adds quarto-critic; .R gets r-reviewer)
4. **Fix** — apply fixes from reviews (critical first)
5. **Re-verify** and **score** against quality gates
6. Loop up to 5 rounds until score meets threshold, then present summary

When the user says "just do it", the orchestrator also auto-commits at score >= 80.

### Quality Gates

Every file gets a score (0-100). Scores below threshold block the action:
- **80** — commit threshold (blocks `git commit` if below)
- **90** — PR threshold (warns if below)
- **95** — excellence (aspirational target)

### Progressive Agent Specialization

Instead of one general-purpose reviewer, use focused agents:
- The **proofreader** only looks at grammar/typos
- The **slide-auditor** only looks at visual layout
- The **pedagogy-reviewer** only looks at teaching quality
- The **domain-reviewer** only looks at field-specific correctness

Each agent is better at its narrow task than a generalist would be.

### The Adversarial Critic-Fixer Loop

Two agents work in opposition:
1. **Critic** reads both Beamer and Quarto, produces harsh findings
2. **Fixer** implements exactly what the critic found
3. Repeat until the critic says "APPROVED" (or 5 rounds max)

This catches notation inconsistencies, overflow, missing content, and visual regressions that single-pass review misses.

### Continuous Learning

Every correction gets tagged with `[LEARN:tag]` format and persists in MEMORY.md across sessions. This prevents Claude from repeating the same mistakes.

### Session Logging

At the end of every substantive session, Claude automatically saves a session log to `quality_reports/session_logs/`. Logs capture what was accomplished, key decisions and their rationale, and open questions for next time. Git records *what* changed; session logs record *why*.

## Adapting for Your Field

1. **Fill in the knowledge base** (`.claude/rules/knowledge-base-template.md`) with your notation, applications, and design principles
2. **Customize the domain reviewer** (`.claude/agents/domain-reviewer.md`) with review lenses specific to your field
3. **Update the color palette** in `Quarto/emory-clean.scss` — change the 3 color variables at the top
4. **Add field-specific R pitfalls** to `.claude/rules/r-code-conventions.md`
5. **Fill in the lecture mapping** in `.claude/rules/beamer-quarto-sync.md`

## Origin

This infrastructure was extracted from **Econ 730: Causal Panel Data** at Emory University, developed by Pedro Sant'Anna using Claude Code over 6+ sessions. The course produced 6 complete PhD lecture decks with 800+ slides, interactive Quarto versions with plotly charts, and full R replication packages — all managed through this multi-agent workflow.
