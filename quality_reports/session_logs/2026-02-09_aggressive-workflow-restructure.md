# Session Log: 2026-02-09 — Aggressive Workflow Restructure

**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Objective

Restructure the entire Claude Code workflow configuration to follow best practices: reduce always-on context from ~1,400 lines to ~220 lines, path-scope situational rules, eliminate duplication, and make the repo approachable for social scientists ramping up on Claude Code.

## Changes Made

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Rewritten from 424 → 119 lines | Constitution-style: principles, commands, tables only |
| `plan-first-workflow.md` | Trimmed 150 → 37 lines | Kept protocol + recovery, removed obvious explanations |
| `orchestrator-protocol.md` | Trimmed 200 → 42 lines | Kept the loop + limits, removed agent selection table |
| `session-logging.md` | Trimmed 120 → 23 lines | Kept 3 triggers, moved template to templates/ |
| `exploration-folder-protocol.md` | Trimmed 262 → 42 lines, added `paths:` | Now path-scoped to `explorations/**` |
| `exploration-fast-track.md` | Trimmed 244 → 20 lines, added `paths:` | Now path-scoped to `explorations/**` |
| `orchestrator-research.md` | **NEW** — 42 lines, path-scoped | Extracted research variant from orchestrator-protocol |
| `quality-gates.md` | Trimmed 145 → 67 lines | Moved merge template to templates/ |
| `knowledge-base-template.md` | Trimmed 222 → 56 lines | Skeleton tables only |
| `no-pause-beamer.md` | Trimmed 29 → 10 lines | Essentials only |
| `r-code-conventions.md` | Trimmed 155 → 105 lines | Cut script structure, console policy |
| `replication-protocol.md` | Trimmed 190 → 103 lines | Cut verbose explanations |
| `pdf-processing.md` | Trimmed 120 → 61 lines | Cut duplicate quick reference |
| `proofreading-protocol.md` | Trimmed 105 → 47 lines | Cut agent prompt template |
| `single-source-of-truth.md` | Trimmed 86 → 69 lines | Cut verbose explanations |
| `tikz-visual-quality.md` | Trimmed 65 → 56 lines | Minor trim |
| `templates/` | **NEW** — 4 files | session-log, quality-report, exploration-readme, archive-readme |
| `README.md` | Updated rules table, counts, fixed stale references | Reflects always-on vs path-scoped split |
| `guide/workflow-guide.qmd` | Updated building blocks, rules section, tips, appendix | Explains path-scoping and ~150 instruction budget |
| `docs/workflow-guide.html` | Re-rendered | Matches updated guide source |

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|----------|------------------------|-----------|
| 3 always-on rules only | Could have 0 always-on (all path-scoped) | Plan-first, orchestrator, and logging apply to ALL tasks |
| Path-scope exploration rules | Keep always-on | Explorations are situational; no need to load for slide work |
| Extract research orchestrator | Keep in orchestrator-protocol | Different audience (R scripts vs slides); reduces always-on size |
| Templates in templates/ | Keep in rules | Templates are reference formats, not instructions; shouldn't auto-load |

## Thorough Review Findings

### Round 1 (initial review)
- README referenced nonexistent "Section 5" in knowledge-base-template — fixed
- README referenced project-specific `emory-clean.scss` instead of generic — fixed
- pdf-processing.md had duplicated quick reference section — fixed

### Round 2 (deep verification)
- CLAUDE.md `quality_score.py` reference was wrongly removed (it's a real 28KB script) — restored
- Guide Setup "Test 3" was wrongly changed to `/deploy` — restored to `quality_score.py`
- Guide appendix hooks table had wrong paths (`scripts/` instead of `.claude/hooks/`) — fixed
- Guide multi-model strategy table claimed agents use `opus`/`sonnet` but all use `inherit` — rewritten to show as recommendation, not current state
- Guide appendix skills table was missing 5 research skills — added
- Guide appendix hooks table only had 1 of 4 hooks — completed
- Guide had no "start simple" message for newcomers — added callout after intro

## Verification Results

| Check | Result | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| CLAUDE.md under 150 lines | 119 lines | PASS |
| Always-on rules under 350 lines | 102 lines | PASS |
| All situational rules have paths: | 14 path-scoped, 3 always-on | PASS |
| Templates in templates/ | 4 files | PASS |
| No content duplication | Confirmed | PASS |
| Guide renders | Output created successfully | PASS |
| All file references valid | Checked cross-references | PASS |

### Round 3 (systematic disk verification — 4 parallel agents)

Launched 4 verification agents in parallel to cross-check every claim in CLAUDE.md, README.md, guide, and rule files against actual files on disk.

**CLAUDE.md:** All 19 skills, 10 agents, folder structure, quality_score.py, sync_to_docs.sh — all verified accurate. No issues.

**README.md:** 6 rules had simplified/inaccurate "Triggers On" values:
- `verification-protocol`: said `.R` but actual is `docs/` — fixed
- `single-source-of-truth`: omitted `Figures/` — fixed
- `pdf-processing`: said `supporting_papers/` but actual is `master_supporting_docs/` — fixed
- `proofreading-protocol`: omitted `quality_reports/` — fixed
- `replication-protocol`: said `Figures/` but actual is only `Figures/*.R` — fixed
- `orchestrator-research`: omitted `Figures/*.R` (acceptable simplification, kept as-is)

**Guide:** Same 3 trigger path issues as README (verification-protocol, pdf-processing, proofreading-protocol) — all fixed in appendix table and inline code block.

**Rule files:** All 17 files verified. 3 always-on (no `paths:` by design), 14 path-scoped (all have correct `paths:` frontmatter). Templates directory confirmed at `templates/` with 4 files. No critical issues.

**False alarms dismissed:**
- Agent flagged "missing templates" — was looking in `.claude/templates/` instead of `templates/` at repo root
- Agent flagged plan-first-workflow.md and session-logging.md as "missing YAML frontmatter" — these are always-on by design (no `paths:` needed)
- Agent flagged content overlap between orchestrator variants and exploration rules — these are intentional complementary files, not duplication

Guide re-rendered and deployed to docs/ after fixes.

### Round 4 (adversarial review — 4 agents)

Launched 4 adversarial agents: guide accuracy, README first impression, CLAUDE.md template usability, cross-document consistency.

**Real issues found and fixed:**

- `docs/index.html` said "16 auto-loaded rules" — changed to "17 context-aware rules"
- README guide section list (lines 175-182) referenced nonexistent section names ("The Agent Ecosystem", "Quality Gates & Verification") — updated to match actual guide headings

**Added:** "Your First Session" starter prompt section to the guide (Section 3, after setup tests). Provides a copy-paste prompt for newcomers — Claude reads all config files and adapts them to the user's project.

**False alarms dismissed (14 total):**

- "EnterPlanMode doesn't exist" — it IS a real Claude Code tool
- "Just do it mode not implemented" — works via natural language; orchestrator rule handles it
- "Skills invocation syntax missing" — `/skill-name` is basic Claude Code usage
- "ggplot-to-plotly overselling" — verified as real feature in translate-to-quarto skill
- "Only 1 hook confirmed" — all 4 configured in settings.json
- "CLAUDE.md skill count says 20" — agent miscounted; table has exactly 19 rows
- "Lecture naming inconsistency" — intentional convention difference (Beamer vs Quarto)
- "Beamer environments don't exist" — template examples with CUSTOMIZE comment
- "domain-reviewer is aspirational" — explicitly labeled as template agent
- "Missing orchestrator decision tree" — Claude chooses based on path-scoped rule loading
- "Quality reports only at merge" — not a contradiction; verification happens every task, reports at merge
- "Nested templates confusion" — the starter prompt IS designed to have Claude fill in CLAUDE.md
- "Repo name confusion" — README correctly uses `claude-code-my-workflow`
- "CLAUDE.md too terse" — by design; guide is the comprehensive reference
